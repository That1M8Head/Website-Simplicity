        <h1>Website simplicity</h1>
        <h2>Why is this website so simplistic?</h2>
        <p>Look, if I wanted to decorate this website with a bunch of images darted around the place, I sure as hell wouldn't be doing it in bare-bones HTML. And that's fine by me.</p>
        <h2>The time it takes</h2>
        <p>I'm sure I could absolutely redo this website and make it fancy and <strong>'professional'</strong> if I was willing to put in the time. Thing is, I'm not, and I don't need to be. A website doesn't <i>need</i> to have a billion images on it with ads and cookies and tracking.</p>
        <p>If I wanted a website like that, I wouldn't make it myself.</p>
        <h2>The <i>original</i> WWW</h2>
        <p>The original World Wide Web, as proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, was intended as a 'universal linked information system'. <i>You can learn more about that by watching <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OFRjZtYs3wY'>this video</a>.</i></p>
        <p>Businesses and companies started making their own websites. I'm not going to go into the history of that, check <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_World_Wide_Web#1995%E2%80%932004:_Commercialization,_dot-com_boom_and_bust,_aftermath'>this Wikipedia page</a> if you want to know.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, you can't visit any major website without being bombarded by cookie popups and advertisements. <i>Not to mention tracking.</i></p>
        <h2>The problem of 'website builders'.</h2>
        <p>You must have heard of website builders before. You know, Wix, Squarespace, all that? They act like the only way you can build a 'good looking website' is with one of those tools.</p>
        <p>Well, guess what?</p>
        <p>This web page, this one you're on right now, is written in pure HTML and CSS. No help from website builders. And it looks amazing.</p>
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>Now, don't get me wrong, I <strong>love</strong> JavaScript. Can't get enough of it. But it doesn't need to be there all the time.</p>
        <p>Most websites you'll see will almost always have JavaScript. <i>Mostly just for ads, tracking and analytics.</i> Even for websites that don't seem to need it.</p>
        <h2>Not all websites should be like this</h2>
        <p>My point wasn't "you MUST have a simplistic website or I will come to your house with a rocket launcher". I'm saying that not all websites need fancy design to be a <i>good website.</i></p>
        <p>Especially for one like this.</p>
        <p>If you have an e-commerce thingy going on, then sure, you can go ahead and use a website builder. Again, I'm not saying <i>don't use external tools.</i> I'm saying that you don't <i>need</i> external tools for a good website.</p>
        <p>Don't overcomplicate and break what already works perfectly.</p>
        <h2>Like how this website looks?</h2>
        <p>You can go ahead and download the <code>simple.css</code> from the GitHub repo! (link below) It's a tiny CSS document, literally less than a kilobyte. It even includes dark mode, y'know, if you swing that way.</p>
        <p>All you need to do after copying it to your website's root directory is include this in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> block:</p>
        <code>
            &lt;link rel='stylesheet' type='text/css' href='simple.css'&gt;
        </code>
        <p>Once that's done, your website will now be formatted to look like this one. And this is free software, too, so you can go ahead and edit it if you want! Change the colours, spacing, add stuff, remove stuff, whatever!</p>
